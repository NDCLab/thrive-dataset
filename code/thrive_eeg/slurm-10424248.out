Attempting to convert data matrix to double precision for more accurate ICA results.

Input data size [58,5464000] = 58 channels, 5464000 frames/nFinding 58 ICA components using extended ICA.
Kurtosis will be calculated initially every 1 blocks using 6000 data points.
Decomposing 1624 frames per ICA weight ((3364)^2 = 5464000 weights, Initial learning rate will be 0.001, block size 78.
Learning rate will be multiplied by 0.98 whenever angledelta >= 60 deg.
Training will end when wchange < 1e-07 or after 512 steps.
Online bias adjustment will be used.
